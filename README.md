🔍 Search Algorithm Suite & Performance Analyzer:  

A C++ command-line program that implements Linear, Binary, Interpolation, and Exponential Search. It compares performance and execution time, helping students understand how different search algorithms behave.

📋 Project Overview:  

Search Algorithm Suite is designed to find a number in a list using multiple search methods. It allows manual input and random array generation, measures execution time, and compares results to determine which algorithm is faster in different scenarios.
